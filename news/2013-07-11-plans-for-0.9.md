For those of you who wanted to donate but did not have an Android device, you can now buy PPSSPP for Windows here: Buy Gold. This also marks the launch of PPSSPP Central where we will later add a compatibility database, screenshot uploads and more in the future - right now all you can do is download the Gold version though.

As for 0.9 plans, you can look forward to a new UI with great gamepad support throughout, and an official Ouya version. In addition, there will be the usual bunch of compatibility fixes, and hopefully we'll be able to squeeze in a few speed improvements, too.
