It's been far too long since the last version but we've made an insane amount of progress. The huge addition of video and audio playback has taken a while and destabilized the emu, but it's really starting to shape up now, so the official version 0.8 will be released within the next two weeks. You won't be disappointed, look forward to games like Crisis Core being pretty much fully playable. Thanks for your patience and support!
