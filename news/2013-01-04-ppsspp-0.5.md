## PPSSPP 0.5: A small step for mankind, a huge step for PPSSPP!

The last release was over a month ago, but believe me, it's been worth the wait! PPSSPP 0.5 brings large compatibility improvements, much better audio, many graphics fixes, savegames working in many games, and save states too! All of this available for both Android and Windows, with more ports coming soon.

In this release we also make available the PPSSPP Gold version, which is a paid version with a golden icon but otherwise identical to the main release. If you want to support the development of PPSSPP, a great way is to buy PPSSPP Gold. Currently only available for Android.

Now, stay tuned for v0.6, for which I have planned to write a dynarec (JIT) for ARM, which will improve speed on Android.
