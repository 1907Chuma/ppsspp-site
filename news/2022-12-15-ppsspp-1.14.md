(NOTE: 1.14.1, released on December 20, fixes a black screen bug on older Android devices, plus some other odds and ends)

(Additionally, 1.14.2-4 fix some additional bugs and hangs.)

This is no ordinary release - a lot of work has gone into fixing up long-standing rendering issues, such as the water in Outrun or characters clipping through the background in Kurohyou 2, smoke showing through walls in Ratchet & Clank, there are new VR builds for Quest and PICO, and many other things! A quick overview of changes:

* Graphics fixes in Burnout Dominator, Kurohyou, Ratchet & Clank, Outrun, Ridge Racer, Spongebob: Yellow Avenger, Cars: Race-o-Rama, Hunter x Hunter, many others
* Performance improvements: Killzone now runs at playable speed, Juiced 2 performance fixed, lighting ubershader optimization
* Many software renderer improvements, both performance and accuracy.
* Brand new VR builds for stand-alone devices: Quest & Pico thanks to the work of Lubos!
* Some input handling fixes, IR interpreter fixes, and so much more.
* There will be a couple of blog posts with a lot more detail about some of the changes early next year when the new website rolls out. Anyway, enjoy!

NOTE: As usual, the Android version will be rolled out gradually, you'll see it in the Play Store within the next few days.
