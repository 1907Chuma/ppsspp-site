I'm not gonna give a date for 0.7, but just thought that I'd give an update. You can look forward to seeing increased compatibility, for example Exit and its sequel now work, and Wipeout now runs at the correct speed, and the emulator will run a bit faster in general as usual. Expect PPSSPP to keep getting faster over time for quite a while longer!

I said previously that 0.7 would have multithreading but I don't think it's worth the trouble yet, there are many easier things to speed up and improve first, so that will happen later. You will still get a noticable speed boost, even if it won't use all your cores.
