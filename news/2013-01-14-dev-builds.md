I have collaborated with Orphis to bring you development builds directly on the [Downloads](/download) page. In other news, things are progressing and even more games are starting to work, including the games I promised for 0.5 but didn't make it to the main branch (FF7CC, FF Type 0). ARMJIT is working on a few Androids but crashing on most, so there's still lots of work to be done before 0.6.
