The free version of PPSSPP 1.17.2 has been re-approved by Apple, and is now [back on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903!)!

The version that's online now is the same as the current Gold version, it includes these new features and fixes:

* Metal/Vulkan-based rendering through MoltenVK, for better performance
* Much improved UI text rendering
