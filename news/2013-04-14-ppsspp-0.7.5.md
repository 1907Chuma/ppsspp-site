## 0.7.5 is out and better than ever!

Another month, another version of PPSSPP! This time I've only added 0.0.5 to the version number, but that's just because I'm saving 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0 for big future updates :) Don't worry, there's been plenty of improvements. Many more games run and some games run faster - the God of War games should now run well on modest PCs and for example the Monster Hunter games are becoming playable on fast phones (although without sound). And I've started to improve the UI - now there's a recent list and game icons in the game selector.

Anyway, stop reading and try it out! And don't forget to buy the Gold version if you use Android and want to support further development.
