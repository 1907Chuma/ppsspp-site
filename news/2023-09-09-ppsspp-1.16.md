For a more detailed summary, see the [progress report and release announcement](/blog/1-16-release-announcement)!

Please note that as usual, the Android version on Google Play will as usual roll out slowly over multiple days in order to catch any bad crashes early, so you may have to wait a few days before you receive the update.

Go to [downloads](/download/) to get it! New: There's now an official Mac build!
