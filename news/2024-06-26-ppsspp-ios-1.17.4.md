## PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.4

PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.4 is out, both Gold and regular, and if you have one of them installed, you should be receiving the update shortly, if you haven't already.

Changes:

* Added setting to control the app switching mode on iOS (you can now get rid of the indicator at the bottom of the screen, at the cost of losing the double-swipe app switching behavior)
* Fixed some bugs in savestate handling that could cause crashes
* Fix bug in IR interpreter causing crashes and strange behavior like wrong camera in the Yu Gi Oh games
* Fix handling of multiple savegames in GTA (didn't always load the most recent one)
* Minor compatibility and rendering fixes

Enjoy!
