PPSSPP has only been out for iOS for a few days, and the response so far has been overwhelming already! It's great to hear from so many people trying out PPSSPP for iOS and enjoying it. Of course, the first release is a bit rough and ready, I prioritized getting it out early over making it perfect. So, here's what you can expect in the first update, which will be submitted for review in about a week:

* Basic soft keyboard support, leading to:
  - RetroAchievements support
  - Nickname editing
* Vulkan rendering through MoltenVK, for a bit of extra performance and features
* Swipe-to-left gesture to go back in menus and to the menu in-game, similar to many other iOS apps
* Screen dimming fixes (like, if you were using your iPad on TV or similar, it won't dim the screen if you're in-game).
* And probably some more!

Stay tuned for more!
