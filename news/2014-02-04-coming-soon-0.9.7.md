The next release, 0.9.7, will have a bunch of fixes that many of you have been waiting for - for example, the Yu Gi Oh games no longer hang when you attempt to move. Also, you will be able to play in portrait mode on Android, and more. Stay tuned for the release, which if all goes well will happen in a week or so.
