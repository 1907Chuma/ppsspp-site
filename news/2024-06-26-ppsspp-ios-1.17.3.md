## PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.3

PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.3 has now been released, both Gold and regular, and if you have one of them installed, you should be receiving the update shortly.

Changes:

* Bluetooth gamepad improvements - Select button now responds properly and the Guide button can be mapped
* Game Mode support in iOS 18
* Fix for math rounding issue that made bosses in Peace Walker unbeatable, among other glitches
* "Double-swipe" protection against accidental app switching
* Swipe-from-left gesture now disabled in-game, as it reduced touch screen performance
* Fix hang when taking screenshots
* Remote Disc Streaming (in your local network) now works

Enjoy!
