PPSSPP is making very, very fast progress, new games are starting up daily but currently things are a bit unstable, many games that have worked have broken again. So, I'm planning to allow for a couple of more weeks of breakneck development and then a few days of stabilization before releasing a 0.5. If you're really impatient, you can build your own but it's quite shaky at the moment. But believe me, 0.5 will be worth the wait. Some things to look forward to:

* Some major games like Final Fantasy Crisis Core and Type-0, Armored Core 3 and Mortal Kombat: Unchained start and * will be at least partly playable
* Many more smaller games start and will be playable
* 3D graphics gets a large speed boost and several major fixes
* Audio much improved, not perfect, but for example, Lumines plays and sounds great!

If you're impatient, you can check out some cool screenshots in this thread and elsewhere on the forum. Note that good-looking graphics doesn't mean it's fully playable, but it's always a step forward.

So stay tuned for 0.5 in January, and then later for 0.6 for which I have planned the really big speed boost which will take a lot of work - an ARM JIT - and then possibly multithreading in 0.7. Until then, merry christmas/channukah/festivus/holidays and a happy new year from the quickly growing PPSSPP team!
