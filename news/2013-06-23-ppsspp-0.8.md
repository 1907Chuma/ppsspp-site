## June 26, 2013: 0.8.1 has been released

0.8.1 is pretty much just a crash fix release, fixing a couple of possible crashes around downloading the Atrac3+ plugin.

For more info see the 0.8 post below :)

## June 23, 2013: 0.8 is here!

Here we go! 0.8, now available for Windows and Android*, brings you the following new features:

* Full video and audio playback in most games (audio requires an optional plugin)
* Huge increases in compatibility! Final Fantasy: Crisis Core is fully playable on fast devices, for example.
* Lots of little things like easy screenshot taking, the beginnings of a cheat feature, etc

Thanks to all the contributors making this possible! I want to call out unknownbrackets and oioitff for outstanding additions.

So get downloading! It may take Google Play some time to update to 0.8.

For those of you on iOS and Blackberry, 0.8 builds will be available soon. We are still looking for a volunteer to maintain a Mac build.

Henrik

Note: A Gold version for Windows is coming in the next few days, for those who want to support the project but don't have Android.
