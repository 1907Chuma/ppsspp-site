## PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.4

PPSSPP for iOS 1.17.4 is out, however the Gold version is unfortuntately stuck in App Store review. If you have the free version installed, it will update automatically.

Changes:

* Added setting to control the app switching mode on iOS (you can now get rid of the indicator at the bottom of the screen, at the cost of losing the double-swipe app switching behavior)
* Fixed some bugs in savestate handling that could cause crashes
* Fix bug in IR interpreter causing crashes and strange behavior like wrong camera in the Yu Gi Oh games
* Fix handling of multiple savegames in GTA (didn't always load the most recent one)
* Minor compatibility and rendering fixes

Enjoy!

More information about the App Store review problems are coming in a blog post Monday.
