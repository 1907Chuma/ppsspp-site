## PPSSPP temporarily gone from Play Store, OpenGL threading success

PPSSPP (not PPSSPP Gold, for some reason) was suspended by Google from the Play Store for unclear reasons. I am appealing the decision. In the meantime, you can download the APK and install it manually.

In other news, the new OpenGL threading code is turning out to be very fast, nearly reaching Vulkan speeds in some cases. So if games are running slow on your device, and it has more than one core - stay tuned for 1.6! It will still be a while though before the code is fully stable, but it's already showing lots of promise.
