## May 30: Taken down

On May 30 I received a complaint from Apple that some games in the built-in Homebrew Store were violating someone's copyright somehow, no details. I don't know or believe that any of them are actually in violation (they are all free to distribute), but I took most of them down for now. I hope Apple will let PPSSPP back in the App Store soon.

For some reason, [PPSSPP Gold](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-gold-psp-emulator/id6502287918) wasn't affected by the takedown, even though it has an identical homebrew store built-in.

## June 1: New builds submitted for review

I have submitted new builds of both PPSSPP and PPSSPP Gold to the App Store for review, hopefully this will trigger Apple into action.

Upcoming improvements:

* Metal/Vulkan-based rendering through MoltenVK, for better performance
* Swipe from left edge to go back
* Much improved UI text rendering
* Many bug and crash fixes
* Support for RetroAchievements
* And more!

Now, we wait for Apple.
