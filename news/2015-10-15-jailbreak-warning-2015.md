## Note for iOS jailbreak users - don't upgrade to iOS 9.0+

Do not upgrade to iOS 9.0+ if you want to keep running PPSSPP short term, stay on 8.4 or earlier. The new jailbreak seems a bit unstable as well.

PPSSPP is not officially supported on iOS like Windows and Android, but we try to keep it working anyway - 9.0 is tricky though, at least if you want to use the JIT. There will probably be a solution but probably not soon.
