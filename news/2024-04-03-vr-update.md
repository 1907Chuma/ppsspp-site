Just a quick note that the merge of the VR build into the general Android build has been reverted in new builds.

For now, we will keep a separate VR build, due to various issues on Quest 2 with the Android "scoped storage" feature, which we are forced to use in the main Android builds.

Support has been added to the [buildbot](/devbuilds) to build the VR builds separately.
