## 0.7.6: Major compatibility fixes!

A serious bug was [fixed](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/commit/1dd738f3119d5171e6c1b2ea974e5a6f21fd810f) and suddenly a ton of vexing issues just disappeared! For example, the 3D graphics being black in Persona 3 and the large graphics errors in the two main GTA games. Those are now very playable (on PC, a bit heavy for mobile)! Also, I found a major bug affecting Little Big Planet among others, fixing that as well. The UI now also has multi-language support, it's in Settings->System.

All these fixes are enough to motivate a new official release, so here we go - 0.7.6! It may take a few hours before it's visible on Google Play.
