# Translation

PPSSPP is translated into a multitude of languages, but as you may have noticed, many of the translations are far from complete.

Unfortunately it's not possible to have an on-duty team adding translations of every new string as they appear, so translations are dependent on volunteer efforts.

If you'd like to contribute to translation, the easiest way to get started is to get a free github account, and then go to [the assets/lang folder on GitHub](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/tree/master/assets/lang) and start editing the .ini file for the language you know.

If you want to be able to test your changes directly in the app, simply download the Windows version (or any other version that lets you easily access the "assets" folder), and go into assets/lang and open the .ini file for the language you want to help with, and make or copy your changes there.

Once happy, you can submit a pull request on Github, or just email the finished .ini file to [the maintainer](hrydgard+translations@gmail.com).
