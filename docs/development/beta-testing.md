# Beta Testing on Android

You will soon be able to join the PPSSPP beta testing program for Android!

A few weeks before each new official release, a beta release will be rolled out to participating people, containing most of the new features that will be in the next release.

I may later roll out beta versions earlier than that, in the middle of each development cycle instead.

The below link will be active soon, if it isn't already when you are reading this:
