# Help, I get a black screen!

Or, your game won't load for one reason or other.

## Don't extract the ISO

Some games can work when played from a folder when extracted, but others require a specific disc layout, and will not work. You have to run the ISO file directly.

## Make sure your ISO file is OK

In PPSSPP, you can right-click (or long-press) the game icon, and on the screen that pops up, press "Calculate CRC". From PPSSPP 1.16 and later, it will tell you if your ISO file is known to be valid with a little green notice.

If not, it might still be a valid file, but it's worth looking into (re-dumping it from UMD, for example).

## Do other games run?

If not, there might be something wrong with your graphics driver, and it might be worth trying another rendering backend in settings.
