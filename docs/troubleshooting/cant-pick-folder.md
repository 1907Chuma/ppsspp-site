# I can't pick a folder on Android

If, when trying to pick a folder to store PSP data in, you get something that looks like this:

Then, either your device is missing a folder picker entirely (which is unlikely if it's a phone, but likely on Android TV), or it's provided by a default app that has been disabled somehow.

I have not been able to figure out how this happens, but a user sent in these screenshots (in Portuguese), showing how he managed to enable it again:

    It was the files app that got disabled. But for some reason,
    differently of other disabled apps that could be reactivated, I
    couldn't do anything.
    Reinstalling the same app from play store did not solved it .
    What worked: reset app preferences.
    I only found it a little bit strange cause that app were disable
    for a long time, and yet the problem happen just now, anyway, that
    solved the problem.
