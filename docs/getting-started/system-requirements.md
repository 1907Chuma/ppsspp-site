# System requirements

PPSSPP is actually extremely efficient and can play most PSP games at good graphical quality on almost any hardware.

You can always push it of course with extra high resolution, post processing filters and so on but the basic experience is attainable on almost anything.

## PC (Windows, Linux)

Any PC made in the last 10 years will have little to no issues running PPSSPP,
as long as you make sure to keep your graphics drivers up to date.

## Android

Any Android device made in the last 10 years will be able to run PPSSPP,
but performance will vary.

## Mac

Any Mac made in the last 10 years will run it alright or better.
