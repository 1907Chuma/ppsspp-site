# Dumping games

To read a game disc into an ISO is called "dumping" for historical reasons.

Basically, you need a PSP with custom firmware.

Here are the basic steps, more detailed instructions will be coming.

* In your PSP's main menu, press Select. In the menu that pops up, choose USB Device to UMD Disc.
* Plug your PSP into your PC using a USB Mini cable. In the PSP menu's leftmost menu, choose USB Connection.
* Your PC should now open up a new window with a single file called ISO9960.ISO.
* Copy that file to your PC, which will take a while.
* Once the copy is done, name it appropriately. It is now ready to be loaded into PPSSPP.
