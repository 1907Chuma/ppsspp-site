# System

## Language

Change the default language of PPSSPP's user interface.

## UI Sound

Enables/disables little sound effects when navigating the UI.

## Emulation

### Fast memory

Fast Memory (unstable)

This option omits checks that memory accesses that the game makes are valid. Thus, there is an increase in speed.

This doesn't mean inaccurate emulation, it's how the real hardware worked, games would crash if they accessed invalid addresses - though turning it off can sometimes paper over crashes caused by other inaccuracies in emulation.

Generally recommend to keep it on.

### Real time clock sync

Tries to keep the emulated CPU in sync with the host CPU by sleeping many times per frame, instead of running a quick burst of emulation per frame. It's not otherwise about accuracy, but can help latency slightly and multiplayer can behave very slightly better.

## Cheats

### Enable Cheats

Used to enable or disable cheats in PPSSPP.
