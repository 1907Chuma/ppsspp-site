# Control settings

There are many ways to control PPSSPP, and a lot of settings to configure so you can find your optimal setup.

## Controls

### Control Mapping

Rebind PSP controls to keyboard, game pad and virtual buttons.

### Calibrate analog stick

Lets you set up deadzones and stuff to adjust the response of the analog stick.

### Enable standard shortcut keys

If this is checked, keys like the Windows key, alt key etc can be used as normal.
If you instead want to map those, uncheck this option.

## On-screen touch controls

### On-screen touch controls

Enable to use on-screen controls. This is mainly useful on
devices such as phones and tablets with no hardware buttons.

### Edit touch control layout...

Used to move on-screen buttons to custom positions.

Hold down a button and drag the button to the desired location. Then click on
Back to save changes.

To Reset changes, press the *Reset* button.

### Button Opacity

Used to change the opacity of buttons. An opacity of 0 is completely transparent.
Opacity of 100 is fully opaque

### Auto-hide buttons after seconds

After this number of seconds of inactivity, touch-screen buttons are hidden. This is
nice when playing on the gamepad or watching long cutscenes.

## Keyboard control settings

### Disable Windows key

Ignores the Windows key when the emulator is running.

### Analog limiter

If you bind a keyboard key to the "Analog limiter" control, it will reduce the magnitude of the analog stick response - so you can walk instead of run, for example. This setting controls the amount by which the magnitude is multiplied to reduce it.

### Haptic Feedback

If this is enabled, the device will vibrate every time a button is pressed.
Useful of mobile devices for tactile feedback.
