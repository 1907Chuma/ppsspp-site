# PPSSPP on macOS

## Installation

You can now download PPSSPP as a regular .dmg, which you can just open, and then drag PPSSPP to Applications, the way you install most normal Mac apps.

## Where's my data?

Currently, the Mac build's user data is stored in .config/ppsspp under your home directory. In there, you'll find a PSP folder, after which it's organized the normal way (it corresponds to the PSP folder on a real PSP memory stick, with the usual PPSSPP additions, like `PSP/SYSTEM/ppsspp.ini` and `PSP/PPSSPP_STATE/`.).
