# Distribution terms of the content in the homebrew store

Traditionally, homebrew apps (unofficial games and apps, created for game consoles by garage enthusiasts) are simply released for free with no distribution restrictions. Since source code is generally not released, and most PSP homebrew was released many years ago, licensing is usually an afterthought and not mentioned at all - so effectively, it's freeware. Homebrew software is distributed freely by many legit websites, such as [DCEmu](www.dcemu.co.uk), [Brewology](https://www.brewology.com/).

Some of these may or may not be available on iOS, depending on the license.

This page was added at the request of Apple. Apple Reviewer, please check the relevant entries here for the homebrew apps that are visible in the iOS PPSSPP Homebrew Store.

No restrictions on distribution are mentioned.
