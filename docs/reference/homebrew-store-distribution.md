# Distribution terms of the content in the homebrew store

Some of these may or may not be available on iOS, depending on the license.

This page was added at the request of Apple. To the Apple App Store reviewer, please check only the entries here that are also actually visible in the iOS PPSSPP Homebrew Store.

## Homebrew

Traditionally, homebrew apps (unofficial games and apps, created for game consoles by garage enthusiasts) are simply released for free with no distribution restrictions. Since source code is generally not released, and most PSP homebrew was released many years ago, licensing is usually an afterthought and not mentioned at all - so effectively, it's freeware. Homebrew software is distributed freely by many legit websites, such as [DCEmu](www.dcemu.co.uk), [Brewology](https://www.brewology.com/).

## Demoscene productions

Like homebrew, demoscene productions are intended for free distribution - they want to be seen! Note that all demoscene productions on the PPSSPP Homebrew Store are pure demos, there are no cracktros or similar.

For some background on the demoscene, [read up here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene).
