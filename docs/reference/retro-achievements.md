# RetroAchievements - setup and use

## What are RetroAchievements?

[RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/) are similar to XBox achievements or PlayStation trophies, except that they're created and defined by a volunteer community. Just like other retro consoles, the PSP itself has no native concept of achievement/trophies. However, this can be added with emulation!

Not only achievements are supported, but also global leaderboards in games that have scores.

## What versions of PPSSPP support RetroAchievements?

RetroAchievements will be supported in PPSSPP 1.16. It is not supported in 1.15.4 and older.

## What games are supported?

Find the list of PSP games with achievement support [here](https://retroachievements.org/gameList.php?c=41).

Unfortunately, it's often the case that only one or two regions of a game are supported. Click the link "Supported game files" to find out, or just log in to your RetroAchievements account in PPSSPP 1.16+

## How do I register?

Simply go to the [RetroAchievements website](https://retroachievements.org/) and sign up for an account. You can then sign into that account in PPSSPP.
