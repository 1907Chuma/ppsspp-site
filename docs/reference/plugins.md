# Plugin support

PPSSPP doesn't support traditional PSP plugins, because those often have a far too tight relationship to the PSP OS kernel to work in an emulator that only pretends the kernel is there.

However, PPSSPP now supports plugins specifically made for the emulator.

These will in the future be available to download and activate directly from the app, but for now, they're still a bit obscure both in discovery in usage.

Important! Save states done without a plugin are not compatible with savestates done with a plugin. So be careful, and prefer using in-game saves whenever possible.

## Installing a plugin

Copy it to PSP/PLUGINS in your memory stick directory.
