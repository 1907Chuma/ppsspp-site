# Plugin support

PPSSPP doesn't support traditional PSP plugins, because those often have a far too tight relationship to the PSP OS kernel to work in an emulator that only pretends the kernel is there.

However, PPSSPP now supports plugins specifically made for the emulator.

These will in the future be available to download and activate directly from the app, but for now, they're still a bit obscure both in discovery in usage.

## Installing a plugin

Copy it to PSP/PLUGINS in your memory stick directory.

## Save States

Plugins are compatible with save states, but updating/removing plugins will not affect the save state. While using plugins, prefer using in-game saves whenever possible.

## Dual Analog Support

Some plugins might add second analog stick support, in order to fully take advantage of this feature, second analog stick needs to be configured in the controls menu.

## Available plugins
