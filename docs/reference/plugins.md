# Plugin support

PPSSPP doesn't support traditional PSP plugins, because those often have a far too tight relationship to the PSP OS kernel to work in an emulator that only pretends the kernel is there.

However, PPSSPP now supports plugins specifically made for the emulator.

These will in the future be available to download and activate directly from the app, but for now, they're still a bit obscure both in discovery in usage.

## Installing a plugin

Copy it to PSP/PLUGINS in your memory stick directory.

## Available plugins

### ThirteenAG's plugins

Multiple plugins are available here, for GTA, Splinter Cell and The Warriors. They add ultra-widescreen fixes, framerate improvements and more.
