# How to update PPSSPP

## Android

Make sure you're installing by the same method as last time:

* If you updated by Google Play last time, do the same.
* If you installed an APK from the buildbot, you'll have to install another one from the buildbot.
* Or if you downloaded an APK directly from the [Downloads page](/downloads), do that. 

If you want to install by another method than before, you need to uninstall first (in which case you should make sure to [backup your save games](/docs/getting-started/save-data-and-storage.md)).

## Windows

Use the same method as last time, and just install over your old copy.

## Other platforms

Generally it works to just install on top of the old copy.
