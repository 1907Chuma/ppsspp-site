# PPSSPP for iOS

Apple does not allow emulators in their App Store, and does not support side-loading like Android does,
so installing PPSSPP on iOS requires an ever-changing set of hacks.

Due to this, PPSSPP for iOS is not officially supported - though, we do try to keep it building. If it works,
it works.

It's highly recommended that if you are interested in emulation on mobile, use Android instead.
