# PPSSPP for iOS

Apple does not allow emulators in their App Store, and does not support side-loading like Android does,
so installing PPSSPP on iOS requires an ever-changing set of hacks.

Due to this, PPSSPP for iOS is not officially supported - though, we do try to keep it building. If it works, it works.

It's highly recommended that if you are interested in emulation on mobile, use Android instead.

However, there are some ways to install it.

Also, this is one way to install it. There may be others.
