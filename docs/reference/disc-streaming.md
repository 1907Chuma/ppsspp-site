# Disc streaming

With the disc streaming feature, you can stream games from one device to another on your local network. This can be useful for testing a large variety of games on a mobile device, for example, without having to copy them over one by one.

This feature is not yet fully polished, but quite workable.

## Setup guide

On your PC (or, the device that has your ISO files and will be streamed from):

1. Run the games you want to share, one after the other, so they all end up in Recent.

1. Then, go into Settings/Tools/Remote Disc Streaming.

1. Click "Share games (server)"

Then, on the device you want to play the games on:

1. Make sure it's on the same network (LAN or WLAN) as the PC from above.

1. Go into Settings/Tools/Remote Disc Streaming.

1. Click "Browse games"

You will hopefully be presented with a list of the games from Recent on the PC, and they should just work to click on and play.
