# Front end integration on Android

If you need this you know what it is, most others won't need to bother. This is here to be google-able.

The action is of course `android.intent.action.VIEW`. 

The activity name is:

`org.ppsspp.ppssppg/org.ppsspp.ppsspp.PpssppActivity`

For PPSSPP Gold, use the following activity name:

`org.ppsspp.ppssppgold/org.ppsspp.ppsspp.PpssppActivity`
