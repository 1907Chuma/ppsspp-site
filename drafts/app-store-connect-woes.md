# App Store Connect - the good, the bad and the ugly

Having published an app on Android for many years now, and finally being able to put it on the iOS App Store, I've had to learn the ropes of iOS app publishing.

It turns out, not very surprisingly, that some things are nicer than on Android, some things are worse than on Android, and some things are just absolutely terrible in comparison.

Here are some comparisons.

## Uploading the app

iOS: Easy peasy from XCode, but nigh-impossible from the command line.
Android: The web interface is smooth these days, though I wish it would stop nagging me about changelogs. There is an API which I have not yet tried out.

## Financial reporting

Android provides nice CSV files that you can extract the necessary information from (to do accurate accounting), and you can get these over a convenient API.

Apple, however, doesn't even expose the most important report (the payment report) through the API at all! You HAVE to log in to Connect and manually download it!

## App Store review

App Store Review is by far the worst experience I've ever had in all of my computing history. It's like talking to a brick wall that only replies once a day, if you're lucky.

It was a hercuelean effort just to get my two apps (PPSSPP Free and Gold) reviewed, then for a while the free version was suspended due to a non-existent issue, but then I thought the coast was clear and I could just focus on features and bugfixes, instead of App Store regularatory details. Oh, how wrong I was. Suddenly, on the third bugfix update, the Gold version got really badly stuck in review.
